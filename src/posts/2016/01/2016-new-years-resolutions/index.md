2015 has been another great year, having purchased my first new car, holiday to Zakynthos, several day trips to London, and I also became an uncle.

2016 is looking to be another bumper year already having plans for two holidays, one somewhere in Europe during the summer for sightseeing and traveling, and another package holiday later in the year just to relax.

Reflecting back on my post from last year it's been pretty successful.

## Learn a javascript framework

Back in August I started rebuilding my own website using Angular and Lumen and launched it late September, learning a lot in the process. I had tried several different options including Ember and Backbone but finally settled on Angular.

## Contribute more to the open-source community

I had a good attempt at this one and whilst I didn't make any major pull requests, it was a good start. I participated in Hacktoberfest submitting several smaller PRs to a couple of documentation repos. I hope to continue with this and hopefully start submitting bigger PRs in the future.

## Redesign and rebuild my site

I redesigned my site along with rebuilding it with Angular. I didn't blog much however as I neglected the functionality and design in the "admin" section. I've since rebuilt my website again, using the existing front-end. I stripped it well back removing jQuery, Underscore and other larger dependencies leaving just Angular and my own code. With the back-end I completely removed Lumen and imported my posts into Wordpress, using the wp-api plugin to give me access to a REST api to use with Angular.

## Blog more

Well this one didn't really happen. I did keep notes on ideas to blog however, so hopefully I can act on that this year and keep a regular blog going.

## Get back to making healthier food choices and regular exercise

This is a difficult one, I did 3 times last year cut back on the sugar and remove bad foods from my diet, but its so difficult to keep on top of. I did purchase a Fitbit earlier last year and started to regularly go out running with Mother before she had an operation in July. We both plan the pick this up again shortly within the next couple of weeks.

## The plan for 2016

- Blog more... much, much, more.
- Lose weight. (I've set a target of 15st/95kg to begin with)
- Give a talk at a conference/user group
- Give more back to open source
