2014 was a brilliant year, and it started off on good footing.

- January I decided to make my life healthier. Throughout the year I set about making healthier decisions about food, this stuck until about August, but I'm still under my original weight
- February I met the most amazing person, who nearly a year later still puts up with my nerdy-ness
- May I had lost 2 stone just from making healthier food choices
- July I went on my first holiday in 8 years, to Japan
- November I had been with [@TeamCodepotato](https://twitter.com/TeamCodepotato) for a year
- December I went on my second holiday of the year to Berlin and Dortmund

But 2015 has arrived, which means its time to move on to bigger and better things. This year I aim to...

- Learn Angular.js/Ember/Backbone or some form of javascript front-end
- Contribute more to the open-source community
- Redesign and rebuild my site
- Blog more, duh!! A lot lot more
- Read more, be it blogs, books or anything else
- Get back to making healthier food choices and regular exercise
