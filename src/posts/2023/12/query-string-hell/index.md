We came across a bug at work related to query strings and how there‚Äôs basically no agreed way of handling complex structures, or anything beyond strings. I guess that's a given seeing as it's a query _string_. The `x-www-form-urlencode` spec doesn't really cover duplicate keys, but the spec does state that query strings should be parsed as a list. Even so, it appears every corner of the internet has their own, very different, implementations

## Some context

Our api allows you to optionally embed entities in the request using the query string. `?embed=entity`. Fairly common on REST apis. If you want to embed multiple entities you‚Äôd use the following format `?embed[]=entity1&embed[]=entity2`. Again widespread across the internet

On several of our products that consume our api we use the [qs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) to build query strings from an object. This works by calling `qs.stringify({ foo: ‚Äòbar‚Äô })` which outputs `?foo=bar`. Given an array as one of the values `qs.stringify({ foo: [‚Äòbar‚Äô, ‚Äòbaz‚Äô] })` you‚Äôd get `?foo[]=bar&foo[]=baz` so far, so good

On one of our products, we had decided to remove the [qs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs), instead opting to use `URLSearchParams`, which is native to all modern JavaScript environments. Less packages, less bloat, less reliance on third-parties, so improvements all round

## The Problem

The bug in our product occurred on an endpoint on which we were requesting multiple embeds. `URLSearchParams` as expected follows the `x-www-form-urlencode` spec

As it turns out the array syntax our api supports in query strings seems to be a PHP flavour and not part of the aforementioned spec ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We quickly fixed this up with a hacky patch on the api as an immediate fix, and then set about fixing the consuming product and getting a release scheduled

## Internet Democracy

My colleague [@robb](https://rknight.me) tooted a poll and the internet democracy soon put us right. Along with PHP, there‚Äôs some suggestion Rails also supports the same query string syntax

As the poll shows, our api, and so PHP's behaviour is just wrong, and doesn't follow the spec. There‚Äôs also some very wild implementations for behaviors from Google Drive, and BitBucket

## Conclusion

Just because a behaviour is widespread across the internet, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs part of a spec, or that other languages will support the same thing. PHP powers over 70% of identifiable website infrastructure, but not following the spec has promoted a false sense of behavior

I've come across quite a few apis with odd query string behaviours over the years, and I just put it down to them using languages where web isn't their primary focus, but it turns out, they're just following the spec
