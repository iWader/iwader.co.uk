title: "I don’t want tax cuts"
excerpt: Today is the annual budgets, and the big topic of discussion is tax cuts. We already had a cut to national insurance in January, and now they're announcing more tax cuts. I don't want tax cuts. I don't need tax cuts. I need public services to be funded and functional

If there’s money for tax cuts, then there was money available for public services.

Our services are at breaking point. My county council declared that it is bankrupt for the 2023/2024 tax year. Many other councils have been doing this, more than ever before. Their first course of action was to make severe cuts to care homes and services for the elderly and disabled.

The NHS is in a dire situation, it’s a struggle to see a doctor when you need one. Waiting lists are at record highs, despite endless promises from this Tory government to reduce them.

I don’t want tax cuts, I want public services to be funded better, their employees happy, and their users happy. Make the services better for everyone. Make the infrastructure better for everyone.

I don’t want tax cuts in order to essentially pay me a dividend in return. We aren’t shareholders in a private company where the aim is the extract as much profit as possible.

I don’t need a tax cut. Tax cuts only benefit richer people, the more you earn the more the tax cut works for you. This is morally wrong. I need public services, we all need public services, transport, and functioning infrastructure.

I want my local area to be healthy, happy, clean, and well maintained.

I don’t want tax cuts.
